## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/RonyPadilla/Team-page/blob/main/img/My-team-page.png?raw=true)

This project is the solution to the dev challenge my team page, it is a static page in which a list of 6 colleagues with their name and position is displayed in a responsive way.

The project was deployed on netlify, in which I developed a better understanding of the responsive part of css using both flexbox and grid, although short it was a project with its challenges.

### Built With


- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

## Features

This app/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hhmesazsqgKXrTkYkt0U) was to create a page in which different members of a work team are shown. This challenge has its strength in the responsive part, how to apply it and how to choose the best option to be able to apply it.
